Cloud Gov Roadmap

1. Establish Cloud Governance Framework: Develop a comprehensive cloud governance framework that outlines roles, responsibilities and best practices for successful cloud management.
2. Cloud Policy Development: Develop and implement policies and procedures that define acceptable use and security requirements, as well as provide guidance on cloud technology adoption and usage.
3. Risk Management: Establish a risk management program to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate cloud-related risks.
4. Security and Compliance: Identify security and compliance requirements and ensure that all cloud deployments adhere to them.
5. Cloud Cost Optimization: Implement cost optimization strategies to ensure that cloud deployments are as cost-effective as possible.
6. Monitoring and Reporting: Establish a monitoring and reporting system to track cloud performance, utilization, security and compliance.
7. Education and Training: Develop and implement training programs to ensure that all cloud users are properly educated on cloud governance best practices.
8. Governance Review: Review and update the cloud governance framework on a regular basis to ensure that it remains current and relevant.
